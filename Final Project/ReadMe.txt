Tabletop Game Instructions:
-This game is a simple drag & drop that is designed to be used in tangine with a Dungeons & Dragons ruleset
-Currently you simply use the tokens on the board

Later Release Potential:
-I plan to eventually have tokens duplicate so there is no limit to the number of a single token that you use and frees up space in the token selector section that I have.
-I also plan to allow the background to be changed with the click of a button. (such as a forest)

Clonse vs Droids Instruction:
-This game is, essentially, a simply math test. Type into the input field and click submit to answer the math problem. If you get it wrong, you lose a clone trooper. If you get it right, you eliminate a droid. First to 0 loses.

Later Release Potential:
-It would be nice if each clone and droid was an image and they were activiely deleted from the screen upon dieing.

Problems:
-I was unable to get a wait timer so it currently does not tell you when you win or lose. You will have to pay attention to the population left.
-I am still trying to figure out how to move the text under the navigation buttons over to the right of them.

Garen vs Darius Instructions:
-This game is essentially flappy bird. Use the buttons to avoid the obstacles.

Later Release Potential:
-My original plan was to have Garen and Darius on the board with the user chasing an AI around, but I did run out of time so I went back to flappy bird for now.
-This game is not done yet and may have changes in the future.
-I plan on having Darius controlled by an AI and your goal is to chase him around and score points when you come in contact with him.
